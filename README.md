# gofetch
A simple program written in Python to fetch system stats --
kinda like neofetch or fastfetch but not as advanced.

## Does it have ascii?
It prints out ascii art if it detects that you're running a Linux, FreeBSD or macOS system.

## Is it portable?
Maybe. It's written in Python but hasn't been tested outside of *nix operating systems.

## Can I reuse this code?
Sure, as long as you abide by the GNU General Public License.
Go ahead, use it in a distro or something.
